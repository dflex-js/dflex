# DFlex

A Drag-and-Drop library for all JavaScript frameworks implementing an enhanced
transformation mechanism to manipulate DOM elements. It is so far the only
library on internet that manipulates the DOM instead of reconstructing it.

## Abstract Features ‚úÖ

- Dynamic architecture.
- Traverse DOM without calling browser API.
- Transform elements instead of reordering the DOM tree.
- Animated movement from point-x to point-y.
- Prevent drag and drop layout shift.
- Isolated from data flow.
- Headless as it is just functions that do manipulation.
- Event driven API.
- Targeting each DOM node individually.
- Extensible using JSON tree instead of flat recursion.

## Implemented Features üîç

- [x] The original input order which appears when inspecting elements stays the
      same. While the visual order happens after transformation supported by the
      `data-index` attribute to know the order of elements in the visual list.

## Project Content üöÄ

### [**@dflex/dom-gen**](https://github.com/dflex-js/dflex/tree/master/packages/dom-gen)

DFlex DOM relations generator algorithm. It Generates relations between DOM elements based
on element depth so all the registered DOM can be called inside registry without
the need to call browser API. Read once, implement everywhere.

### [**@dflex/core-instance**](https://github.com/dflex-js/dflex/tree/master/packages/core-instance)

Core instance is the mirror of interactive element that includes all the properties and methods to manipulate the node.

### [**@dflex/utils**](https://github.com/dflex-js/dflex/tree/master/packages/utils)

A collection of shared functions. Mostly classes, and types that are used across
the project.

### [**@dflex/store**](https://github.com/dflex-js/dflex/tree/master/packages/store)

DFex Store has main registry for all DOM elements that will be manipulated. It
is a singleton object that is accessible from anywhere in the application. The
initial release was generic but it only has the Core of the library since ^V3.

### [**@dflex/draggable**](https://github.com/dflex-js/dflex/tree/master/packages/draggable)

Light weight draggable element without extra functionalities that is
responsible for interacting with the DOM and moving the affected element(s).

### [**@dflex/dnd**](https://github.com/dflex-js/dflex/tree/master/packages/dnd)

The main package that depends on the other packages. It is responsible for the
magical logic of the library to introduce the drag and drop interactive
functionality.

## Installation üì¶

DFlex contains multiple packages that shapes the final product. All Packages are
decoupled and work separately. Each package has it own universe including test
and playground or at lease this is the initial plan.

DFlex is written entirely in plain JavaScript/TypeScript and doesn't depend on
any specific framework. However, it's using the
[**React**](https://reactjs.org/) for playground and
[**Cypress**](https://www.cypress.io/) for end to end testing. It's also
using [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing and
[**PNPM**](https://pnpm.io/) to manage the packages.

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dflex-js/dflex.git
cd dflex
pnpm install
```

This will clone and install all development dependencies. If you are using
windows you probably have to install cypress manually as following:

```bash
pnpm cy:install:win
```

To start development you can use the following command:

```bash
pnpm --filter @dflex/dnd server
```

This will run the development playground for the DnD package. Open the browser
[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to see the playground. You can
check the code in the
[**packages/dnd/playgrounds**](https://github.com/dflex-js/dflex/blob/dev/update_main_page/packages/dnd/playgrounds/dflex-react-dnd/src/App.tsx)
to see the available routing.

If you want to change the codebase and live edit the playground you have to
compile while running the playground. You can use the following command:

```bash
pnpm --filter @dflex/dnd compile:w
pnpm --filter @dflex/dnd build:w
pnpm --filter @dflex/dnd run server

```

After finish editing you can make sure the changes you make are not going to
break the code. You can do that by running the test and have some fun watching
Cypress do the job:

```bash
pnpm --filter @dflex/dnd test
```
