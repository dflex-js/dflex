# DFlex

A Drag-and-Drop library for all JavaScript frameworks implementing an enhanced
transformation mechanism to manipulate DOM elements.

## Features ‚úÖ

- Dynamic architecture.
- Traverse DOM without calling browser API.
- Transform elements instead of reordering the DOM tree.
- Animated movement from point-x to point-y.
- Prevent drag and drop layout shift.
- Isolated from data flow.
- Headless as it is just functions that do manipulation.
- Event driven API.
- Targeting each DOM node individually.
- Extensible using JSON tree instead of flat recursion.
