# @dflex/draggable

DFlex Draggable is the simplest solution to create JavaScript draggable
elements. No need for a special tutorial and thinking about implementation
complexity or even migration to different technologies for different frameworks.
It can be used with any app you have whether it is React, Vue, Angular or
Svelte.

## DFlex Features ‚úÖ

- Dynamic architecture.
- Traverse DOM without calling browser API.
- Transform elements instead of reordering the DOM tree.
- Animated movement from point-x to point-y.
- Prevent drag and drop layout shift.
- Isolated from data flow.
- Headless as it is just functions that do manipulation.
- Event driven API.
- Targeting each DOM node individually.
- Extensible using JSON tree instead of flat recursion.

## Installation üì¶

```bash
npm install @dflex/draggable
```
