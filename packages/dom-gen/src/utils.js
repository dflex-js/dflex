/**
 * Generates unique key by combined depth with element current index.
 *
 * Ideally, each element should be connected with parent-id.
 * If we have element-id1, we should know who's the parent by parent-id.
 * But, currently this is not possible children render first. Instead,
 * we use counters combined with depth as parent-identifier. Vice-versa.
 *
 * @param {number} depth
 * @param {number} index
 * @returns {string} - unique key
