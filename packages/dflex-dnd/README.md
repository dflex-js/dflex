# DFlex

A Drag-and-Drop library for all JavaScript frameworks implementing an enhanced
transformation mechanism to manipulate DOM elements. It is so far the only
library on internet that manipulates the DOM instead of reconstructing it.

## Features ‚úÖ

- Dynamic architecture.
- Traverse DOM without calling browser API.
- Transform elements instead of reordering the DOM tree.
- Animated movement from point-x to point-y.
- Prevent drag and drop layout shift.
- Isolated from data flow.
- Headless as it is just functions that do manipulation.
- Event driven API.
- Targeting each DOM node individually.
- Extensible using JSON tree instead of flat recursion.
- Support three different types of restrictions:<br/>
  1 -Restricted area related to the parent container.<br/>
  2- Restricted area related to the viewport.<br/>
  3- Restricted area related to the position itself.
- Support four types of custom events with custom layout state emitter.
- Auto remove selection when starting dragging.

## Implemented Transformation üí°

- The original input order which appears when inspecting elements stays the
  same. While the visual order happens after transformation and it's supported by the
  `data-index` attribute to know the order of elements in the visual list.<br/><br/>

- To enable handling a large set of elements, the transformation is related
  to the viewport. No matter how many elements are affected, DFlex only
  transforms elements visible on the screen. Elements outside the viewport are
  triggered to a new position when they are visible.<br/><br/>

- Support strict transformation between containers.<br/><br/>
