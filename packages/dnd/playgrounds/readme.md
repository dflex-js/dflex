# Playgrounds purpose

These playgrounds intends to be used for testing purpose with Cypress. As `DFlex`
works with multiple frameworks, there are different apps for different
technologies.

Also, it's a good way to understand the Dflex implementation so it can be
useful as starter.

**Note** Currently, all end-to-end tests are used with react playground any
changes in it will break the results.

As we have here [React](https://github.com/dflex-js/dflex/tree/master/packages/dnd/playgrounds/dflex-react-dnd)
and [Vue](https://github.com/dflex-js/dflex/tree/master/packages/dnd/playgrounds/dflex-vue-dnd),
further implementations can be added as starters.
