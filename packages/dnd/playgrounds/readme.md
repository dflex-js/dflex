# Playgrounds purpose

These playgrounds intends to be used for testing purpose with Cypress. As `DFlex`
works with multiple frameworks, there are different apps for different
technologies.

Also, it's a good way to understand the Dflex implementation so it can be
useful as starter.

**Note** Currently, all end-to-end tests are used with react playground any
changes in it will break the results.
