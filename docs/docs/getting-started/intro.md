> JavaScript Project to Manipulate DOM Elements

DFlex is a JavaScript solution. It is not a solution for a specific
framework. A pure JavaScript library. Every fix, feature, or enhancement
will affect all framework implementations.

It is a solution to native-like browser API focused on performance and easy
implementation.

Dflex contains a collection of utility packages for DOM. Focused on
performance and extensibility. All packages are decoupled. Work
separately to prevent a bloated bundle in production and to make it
easier to maintain.

DFlex is also extensible. In most existing solutions the more elements
you are trying to manipulate the more lagging you get. With DFlex, no
matter how many elements you are dealing with itâ€™s always going to be
smooth manipulation.

It has parent/children architecture. So you can manipulate a child or parent.
Entries are not an array, and not necessary to be in order. Works with async
rendering from parents to children or vice versa because it has a flexible
design.

Every node manipulation is calculated and exposed. So you can add your
own functionality without starting from scratch.
