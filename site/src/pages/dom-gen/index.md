# @dflex/dom-gen

DOM relations generator algorithm.

```bash
npm install @dflex/dom-gen
```

Generates relations between DOM elements based on element depth. For each DOM
node, it generates three keys: Siblings, Parent and Children keys and two
indexes one refers to node order in its level and the other refers to the parent
index in parental level. Together: keys and indexes combined form of
uniqueness for each element.

In case you are dealing with any DOM-tree, you can build entire branches and traverse
through them using these generated unique keys and indexes. Think of relational
database or hash tables but applied in DOM tree.

## Generates element pointer

Element pointer refers to the element position and its relationship in DOM tree.
It's represented with `getElmPointer` as following:

```ts
const domGen = new Generator()

domGen.getElmPointer(id: string, depth: number)
```

Returns pointer object refers to element relation with its keys and related
index:

- `order: Object <elementOrder>`

  - `self: number` - Element self index among its siblings.
  - `parent: number` - Parent index among its siblings.

- `keys: Object <relationKey>`

  - `sK: string` - Siblings Key, connects nodes in the same level.
  - `pK: string` - Parent key, connects nodes in the higher level.
  - `chK: string` - Children Key, connects nodes in the lower level.

```js
import Generator from "@dflex/dom-gen";

const domGen = new Generator();

let pointer = domGen.getElmPointer("id-0", 0);

// pointer = {
//   keys: {
//     chK: null,
//     pK: "1-0",
//     sK: "0-0",
//   },
//   order: {
//     parent: 0,
//     self: 0,
//   },
// };
```

Internally `Generator` has build dom tree as following:

```bash
DOM-root
│
│───id-0 => order: { parent: 0, self: 0 } || keys: { chK: null , pK: "1-0", sK: "0-0" }
```

Adding more elements on the same level:

```js
const pointer1 = domGen.getElmPointer("id-1", 0);

// pointer1 = {
//   keys: {
//     chK: null,
//     pK: "1-0",
//     sK: "0-0",
//   },
//   order: {
//     parent: 0,
//     self: 1,
//   },
// };

const pointer2 = domGen.getElmPointer("id-2", 0);

// pointer2 = {
//   keys: {
//     chK: null,
//     pK: "1-0",
//     sK: "0-0",
//   },
//   order: {
//     parent: 0,
//     self: 2,
//   },
// };
```

And dom tree is:

```bash
DOM-root
│
│───id-0 => order: {parent: 0, self: 0} || keys: {chK: null, pK: "1-0", sK: "0-0"}
│
│───id-1 => order: {parent: 0, self: 1} || keys: {chK: null, pK: "1-0", sK: "0-0"}
│
│───id-2 => order: {parent: 0, self: 2} || keys: {chK: null, pK: "1-0", sK: "0-0"}
```

**Note:** ids form 0 to 2, all have same parent and siblings key. And it
guarantees that any any incoming parent will carry key `1-0` and exists in
position `0`.

This goes also for any parent. Eventually, by using keys and indexes you can go up↑
and down↓.

Following the same logic we can go deeper:

```js
const pointer = domGen.getElmPointer("id-parent-1", 1);

// pointer = {
//   keys: {
//     chK: "0-0",
//     pK: "2-0",
//     sK: "1-0", // this key was generated previously in children level.
//   },
//   order: {
//     parent: 0, // all children aware of their parent index.
//     self: 0,
//   },
// };
```

Changing the depth identifies new level. Take a look at current dom tree that we
now have:

```bash
DOM-root
├───id-parent-1  => order: {parent: 0, self: 0} || keys: {chK: "0-0", pK: "2-0", sK: "1-0"}
    |
    │───id-0  => order: {parent: 0, self: 0} || keys: {chK: null, pK: "1-0", sK: "0-0"}
    │
    │───id-1 => ..
    │
    │───id-2 => ..

```

**Take into consideration some major points:**

- It works both ascending and descending. So, it doesn't care how nodes are
  mounted and it works with async mounting.

- It automatically attaches the tree and links each node to the suitable parent
  and siblings.

## Dealing with branches

Despite the fact that `Generator` is not DOM store, it maintains some kind of
data to keep generate unique pointers. Every incoming node element belong to
branch contains all input ids distrusted by depth/level entries.

### Getting branches

```ts
domGen.getElmBranch(sk: string) : string<id> | Array<ids>
```

where `sk` represents siblings key generated by `getElmPointer`. Going back to
our generated tree:

```js
const branchChildren = domGen.getElmBranch("0-0");

// branchChildren = ["id-0", "id-1", "id-2"];
```

Since we have only one parent `branchParents` contain one node only:

```js
const branchParents = domGen.getElmBranch("1-0");

// branchParents = "id-parent-1";
```

To get all branches:

```js
const { branches } = domGen;

// branches = {
//   "0-0": ["id-0", "id-1", "id-2"],
//   "1-0": "id-parent-1",
// };
```

### Updating branches

There's no point in having DOM treemap without the ability to update it
according to some logic you've already implemented in your app. Following common
sense, you can do it easily with `setElmBranch`.

```ts
domGen.setElmBranch(sk: string, branch: string<id>|Array<ids>)
```

Let's continue working on our branches by switching the order of children.
Currently, we have: `"0-0": ["id-0", "id-1", "id-2"]` but element with `id-1`
has been switched with `id-2`.

```js
const { branches } = domGen;

const newBranch = ["id-0", "id-2", "id-1"];

domGen.setElmBranch("0-0", newBranch);

// branches = {
//   "0-0": ["id-0", "id-2", "id-1"],
//   "1-0": "id-parent-1",
// };
```
